[Assessing Risk of Mortality in Californian Teachers](https://eshkim1021.github.io/PM-606-Final/)

 - __Primary Objective__: Analyze the effect of hospitalization data (diagnoses,co-morbidites, length of stay, etc.) and demographic factors on mortality rate
 - Build machine learning models to predict mortality after hospitalization 
 - Perform logsitic regression to quantify the effect of features on the short-term risk of death

[Predicting Patient Mortality During Hospitalization](https://eshkim1021.github.io/PM-566-Final/README.html)

 - __Primary Objective__: Analyzed features such as patient demography, severity of disease, and comorbidities to predict inpatient mortality using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) dataset
 - Compared the effectiveness and accuracy of three different prediction models (logistic, random forest, LASSO) in determining patient mortality in hospitals throughout the United States.

[Exploratory Analysis of Covid-19 Deaths in the United States from February 2020 to August 2020](https://eshkim1021.github.io/PM-566-Final/)

 -  __Primary Objetive__: Analyze the effect of population density on the number of deaths due to Covid-19 in each state in the US
 -  Visualize the relationship between age, state, and population density on Covid-19 deaths
 -  Determine if the relationships found are statistically significant using a poisson regression model
